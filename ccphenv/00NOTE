Analyzing the cross-covariance between phenotype and environmental cues.

Convention:
X,Y = P (phenotype) or E (developmental cue)
Xa = X(env_a) where a = 0 (ancestral) or 1 (novel) environment.
dX = X1 - X0
DXa = X(env_a) - <X(env_a)>
dDX = DX1 - DX0 = dX - <dX> = DdX

<dDXdDY> = <DdXDdY> = <dXdY> - <dX><dY>: cross-covariance between dX and dY.
Thus, <dXdY> = <dX><dY> + <dDXdDY>
